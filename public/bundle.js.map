represent the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. The\n      primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n      registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n      why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n      Terminology\n      -----------\n\n      - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n      - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n      - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n      - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n      - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n      - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\n      A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\n      Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n      state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n      rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\n      Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n      promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n      settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n      itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n      itself fulfill.\n\n\n      Basic Usage:\n      ------------\n\n      ```js\n      var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n        // on success\n        resolve(value);\n\n        // on failure\n        reject(reason);\n      });\n\n      promise.then(function(value) {\n        // on fulfillment\n      }, function(reason) {\n        // on rejection\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Advanced Usage:\n      ---------------\n\n      Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n      `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\n      ```js\n      function getJSON(url) {\n        return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n          var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n          xhr.open('GET', url);\n          xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n          xhr.responseType = 'json';\n          xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n          xhr.send();\n\n          function handler() {\n            if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n              if (this.status === 200) {\n                resolve(this.response);\n              } else {\n                reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n              }\n            }\n          };\n        });\n      }\n\n      getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n        // on fulfillment\n      }, function(reason) {\n        // on rejection\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\n      ```js\n      Promise.all([\n        getJSON('/posts'),\n        getJSON('/comments')\n      ]).then(function(values){\n        values[0] // => postsJSON\n        values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\n        return values;\n      });\n      ```\n\n      @class Promise\n      @param {function} resolver\n      Useful for tooling.\n      @constructor\n    */\n    function lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise(resolver) {\n      this._id = lib$es6$promise$promise$$counter++;\n      this._state = undefined;\n      this._result = undefined;\n      this._subscribers = [];\n\n      if (lib$es6$promise$$internal$$noop !== resolver) {\n        if (!lib$es6$promise$utils$$isFunction(resolver)) {\n          lib$es6$promise$promise$$needsResolver();\n        }\n\n        if (!(this instanceof lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise)) {\n          lib$es6$promise$promise$$needsNew();\n        }\n\n        lib$es6$promise$$internal$$initializePromise(this, resolver);\n      }\n    }\n\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.all = lib$es6$promise$promise$all$$default;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.race = lib$es6$promise$promise$race$$default;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.resolve = lib$es6$promise$promise$resolve$$default;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.reject = lib$es6$promise$promise$reject$$default;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._setScheduler = lib$es6$promise$asap$$setScheduler;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._setAsap = lib$es6$promise$asap$$setAsap;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._asap = lib$es6$promise$asap$$asap;\n\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.prototype = {\n      constructor: lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise,\n\n    /**\n      The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n      which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n      reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function(user){\n        // user is available\n      }, function(reason){\n        // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Chaining\n      --------\n\n      The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\n      promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n      or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        return user.name;\n      }, function (reason) {\n        return 'default name';\n      }).then(function (userName) {\n        // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n        // will be `'default name'`\n      });\n\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\n      }, function (reason) {\n        throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');\n      }).then(function (value) {\n        // never reached\n      }, function (reason) {\n        // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\n        // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.\n      });\n      ```\n      If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\n      }).then(function (value) {\n        // never reached\n      }).then(function (value) {\n        // never reached\n      }, function (reason) {\n        // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Assimilation\n      ------------\n\n      Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n      retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n      fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n      until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n      }).then(function (comments) {\n        // The user's comments are now available\n      });\n      ```\n\n      If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n      }).then(function (comments) {\n        // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n      }, function (reason) {\n        // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Simple Example\n      --------------\n\n      Synchronous Example\n\n      ```javascript\n      var result;\n\n      try {\n        result = findResult();\n        // success\n      } catch(reason) {\n        // failure\n      }\n      ```\n\n      Errback Example\n\n      ```js\n

Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n// the system to stop doing the transform.

Plugins might want to do this, so that they can use event\n * dispatching as a tool that helps them decide which events should be extracted\n * in the first place.\n *\n * \"On-Demand-Dispatched Events\":\n *\n * - On-demand-dispatched events are not returned from `extractEvents`.\n * - On-demand-dispatched events are dispatched during the process of returning\n *   the deferred-dispatched events.\n * - They should not have side effects.\n * - They should be avoided, and/or eventually be replaced with another\n *   abstraction that allows event plugins to perform multiple \"rounds\" of event\n *   extraction.\n *\n * Therefore, the sequence of event dispatches becomes:\n *\n * - `R`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `R` on-demand)\n * - `S`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `S` on-demand)\n * - `C`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `C` on-demand)\n * - `R`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n * - `S`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n * - `C`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n *\n * In the case of `ResponderEventPlugin`: If the `startShouldSetResponder`\n * on-demand dispatch returns `true` (and some other details are satisfied) the\n * `onResponderGrant` deferred dispatched event is returned from\n * `extractEvents`. The sequence of dispatch executions in this case\n * will appear as follows:\n *\n * - `startShouldSetResponder` (`ResponderEventPlugin` dispatches on-demand)\n * - `touchStartCapture`       (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n * - `touchStart`              (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n * - `responderGrant/Reject`   (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n *\n * @param {string} topLevelType Record from `EventConstants`.\n * @param {string} topLevelTargetID ID of deepest React rendered element.\n * @param {object} nativeEvent Native browser event.\n * @return {*} An accumulation of synthetic events.\n */\nfunction setResponderAndExtractTransfer(\n    topLevelType,\n    topLevelTargetID,\n    nativeEvent) {\n  var shouldSetEventType =\n    isStartish(topLevelType) ? eventTypes.startShouldSetResponder :\n    isMoveish(topLevelType) ? eventTypes.moveShouldSetResponder :\n    eventTypes.scrollShouldSetResponder;\n\n  var bubbleShouldSetFrom = responderID || topLevelTargetID;\n  var shouldSetEvent = SyntheticEvent.getPooled(\n    shouldSetEventType,\n    bubbleShouldSetFrom,\n    nativeEvent\n  );\n  EventPropagators.accumulateTwoPhaseDispatches(shouldSetEvent);\n  var wantsResponderID = executeDispatchesInOrderStopAtTrue(shouldSetEvent);\n  if (!shouldSetEvent.isPersistent()) {\n    shouldSetEvent.constructor.release(shouldSetEvent);\n  }\n\n  if (!wantsResponderID || wantsResponderID === responderID) {\n    return null;\n  }\n  var extracted;\n  var grantEvent = SyntheticEvent.getPooled(\n    eventTypes.responderGrant,\n    wantsResponderID,\n    nativeEvent\n  );\n\n  EventPropagators.accumulateDirectDispatches(grantEvent);\n  if (responderID) {\n    var terminationRequestEvent = SyntheticEvent.getPooled(\n      eventTypes.responderTerminationRequest,\n      responderID,\n      nativeEvent\n    );\n    EventPropagators.accumulateDirectDispatches(terminationRequestEvent);\n    var shouldSwitch = !hasDispatches(terminationRequestEvent) ||\n      executeDirectDispatch(terminationRequestEvent);\n    if (!terminationRequestEvent.isPersistent()) {\n      terminationRequestEvent.constructor.release(terminationRequestEvent);\n    }\n\n    if (shouldSwitch) {\n      var terminateType = eventTypes.responderTerminate;\n      var terminateEvent = SyntheticEvent.getPooled(\n        terminateType,\n        responderID,\n        nativeEvent\n      );\n      EventPropagators.accumulateDirectDispatches(terminateEvent);\n      extracted = accumulateInto(extracted, [grantEvent, terminateEvent]);\n      responderID = wantsResponderID;\n    } else {\n      var rejectEvent = SyntheticEvent.getPooled(\n        eventTypes.responderReject,\n        wantsResponderID,\n        nativeEvent\n      );\n      EventPropagators.accumulateDirectDispatches(rejectEvent);\n      extracted = accumulateInto(extracted, rejectEvent);\n    }\n  } else {\n    extracted = accumulateInto(extracted, grantEvent);\n    responderID = wantsResponderID;\n  }\n  return extracted;\n}\n\n/**\n * A transfer is a negotiation between a currently set responder and the next\n * element to claim responder status.
